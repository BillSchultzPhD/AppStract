# AppStract
Some R markdown code to webscrape article titles and abstracts from the most recent issue of whatever journals you'd like. I was surprised that I couldn't find a tool like this that already exists. The code creates an HTML document (using the "readable" markdown theme) wherever the working directory on your machine is set, with the results for each journal in a separate table. I'm sure that the code itself is not optimal, but it is (or should be?) functional, as long as the HTML coding for these journal webpages is consistent over time. I'll update as I encounter more bugs over time and find ways around them. You may run into some occassional errors due to server timeouts and the like; I'm not sure what I can do about that on the coding end. Just try running it again. The code requires some upfront setup to add new journals (take a look at other journals to see the structure), as well as a little trial-and-error to make sure new journals are working properly. The trickiest part is finding parts of the webpage you can use to pull titles and abstracts using CSS selectors.

As is, this script currently compiles titles and abstracts for the most recent issues of the top 3 Political Science journals (APSR, AJPS, JOP). It also compiles abstracts from the latest article of a few other journals of interest to quantitative Comparative Politics and IR scholars: IO; World Politics; Comparative Political Studies; and Political Analysis. It runs a bit slow; each journal will take two minutes or so. If you have any suggestions on journals to include, let me know. "Appstract-other" compiles abstracts and titles for environmental and economics journals, which may be more interesting to those of you who aren't political scientists.

This is still a work in process. I'm sure it could use plenty of fine tuning.
