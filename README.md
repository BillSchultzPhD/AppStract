# AppStract
Some R code to webscrape article titles and abstracts from the most recent issue of whatever journals you'd like. Not pretty, but functional. Requires some upfront setup for each journal, but should work stably after that's done. Coding this was probably not the best use of my time.

Currently compiles titles and abstracts (with a bit of messy formatting in some cases) for the 3 "big three" Political Science Journals. The code runs a bit slow, each journal will take two minutes or so.
