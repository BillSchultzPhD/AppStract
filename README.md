# AppStract
Some R markdown code to webscrape article titles and abstracts from the most recent issue of whatever journals you'd like. It creates an HTML document with the results stored in a table, using the "readable" markdown theme. The code itself might not be pretty, but it is (or should be) functional. The code requires some upfront setup for each journal, but it should work stably after that's done.

This script currently compiles titles and abstracts (with a bit of messy formatting in some cases) for the 3 top Political Science journals. The code runs a bit slow, each journal will take two minutes or so. If you have any suggestions on journals to include, let me know. You should be able to use the existing examples to add other journals yourself. I'll expand the list over time.
